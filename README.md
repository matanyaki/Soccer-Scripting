**Soccer Scripting Challenge**

*Overview*
This project is a soccer-themed adaptation of the Sumo Battle prototype developed in Unity. The player controls a ball on a soccer field, attempting to knock enemy balls into the opposing net while preventing them from entering their own. Each round introduces more enemy balls, testing your defense and skill. The challenge is to apply what was learned in the Sumo Battle prototype to create a functional and engaging soccer game, despite the many non-functional elements present at the start.

*Features*

  Player Control: Rotate the camera around the player's ball and apply a forward force to move.

  Enemy Behavior: Enemy balls move towards your net, and you can hit them to deflect them away.

  Power-ups: Temporary strength boosts that disappear after 5 seconds.

  Wave System: After each round, a new wave spawns with an additional enemy ball.

*Challenge Outcome*
  Enemies actively seek out your net, providing constant challenge.
  
  Power-ups give you a temporary strength boost to help fend off enemies.
  
  New waves spawn after all enemy balls are cleared, increasing the difficulty over time.

*How to Play*

Objective:

  Knock enemy balls into the opposing net while preventing them from entering your net.
  Survive as many waves as possible as the number of enemy balls increases.

Controls:

  Camera Rotation: Use the mouse to rotate the camera around your ball.
  Movement: Hold down the W key (or forward key) to apply a forward force and move the ball in the direction the camera is facing.
  Power-ups: Collect power-ups scattered across the field for a temporary strength boost. They last for 5 seconds before disappearing.
Game Mechanics:

  Enemy Balls: Enemy balls will move towards your net. Hit them to deflect them away.
  Power-ups: Picking up a power-up gives you a temporary strength boost, allowing you to hit the enemy balls with more force.
  Waves: Each time you clear all enemy balls, a new wave will spawn with one more enemy ball than the previous wave, increasing the challenge.
